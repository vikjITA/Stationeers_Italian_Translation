Remember there are two ways to interact with your inventory. You can press and hold {KEY:MouseControl} to enable the mouse cursor, and then drag and drop or open things with the mouse. For fast control, press {KEY:ToolBeltSlot} to open your {SLOT:Belt} slot. Press {KEY:InventorySelect} to swap the highlighted interior slot item to your hands.

If you find you have too many windows open, you can close them all at once using {KEY:HideAllWindows}, you can toggle the individual window with their slot hotkey, or you can click on the slot itself while the mouse is enabled with {KEY:MouseControl}.</Value>
